# Streamlined Approach to Trading Strategy Development

This document describes our streamlined approach to developing, testing, and deploying trading strategies.

## Strategy Development Process

1. Idea generation based on market research or algorithmic pattern discovery
2. Prototype implementation in isolated environment
3. Backtesting against historical data
4. Parameter optimization and model tuning
5. Forward testing in paper trading environment
6. Performance analysis and refinement
7. Live deployment with conservative capital allocation
8. Ongoing monitoring and adjustment

## Key Principles

- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Test thoroughly before deploying
- Use proper risk management at all stages
- Document all strategy logic and parameters
- Monitor for strategy decay or market condition changes

## Technology Stack

Our streamlined approach leverages:

- Python for all development
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for ML models
- Alpaca API for execution
- Custom backtesting framework
- Automated monitoring tools

## Evaluation Metrics

- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Win/Loss Ratio
- Profit Factor
- Return on Investment
- Beta to market

## Risk Management

- Position sizing based on volatility
- Stop loss implementation
- Exposure limits per strategy
- Correlation analysis between strategies
- Automated circuit breakers

## Continuous Improvement

The strategy development process is cyclical, with continuous improvement based on performance data and changing market conditions.
